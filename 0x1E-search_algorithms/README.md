C - Search Algorithms

This project at ALX focused on search algorithms, where I implemented different types and documented their respective space and time complexities.

**TASKS**

Linear Search

File: 0-linear.c

Description: Implement a C function that performs linear search to find a value in an array of integers. Returns the index of the first occurrence of the value, or -1 if not found or if the array is NULL.

Binary Search

File: 1-binary.c

Description: Implement a C function that performs binary search on a sorted array of integers. Returns the index of the value if found, or -1 if not found or if the array is NULL. Assumes the array is sorted in ascending order and the value is unique.

Big O #0

File: 2-O

Description: Text file documenting the worst-case time complexity of linear search.

Big O #1

File: 3-O

Description: Text file documenting the worst-case space complexity of iterative linear search.

Big O #2

File: 4-O

Description: Text file documenting the worst-case time complexity of binary search.

Big O #3

File: 5-O

Description: Text file documenting the worst-case space complexity of binary search.

Big O #4

File: 6-O

Description: Text file documenting the space complexity of the allocate_map function which allocates a 2D array of integers.

Jump Search

File: 100-jump.c

Description: Implement a C function that performs jump search on a sorted array of integers, using the square root of the array size as the jump step. Returns the index of the value if found, or -1 if not found or if the array is NULL.

Big O #5

File: 101-O

Description: Text file documenting the average-case time complexity of jump search in an array of size n using step = sqrt(n).

Interpolation Search

File: 102-interpolation.c

Description: Implement a C function that performs interpolation search on a sorted array of integers. Returns the index of the value if found, or -1 if not found or if the array is NULL. Assumes the array is sorted in ascending order.

Exponential Search

File: 103-exponential.c

Description: Implement a C function that performs exponential search on a sorted array of integers. Uses powers of 2 as exponential ranges to search the array. Returns the index of the value if found, or -1 if not found or if the array is NULL. Assumes the array is sorted in ascending order.

Advanced Binary Search

File: 104-advanced_binary.c

Description: Implement a C function that performs advanced binary search on a sorted array of integers. Returns the index of the value if found, or -1 if not found or if the array is NULL. Assumes the array is sorted in ascending order.

Jump Search in a Singly Linked List

File: 105-jump_list.c

Description: Implement a C function that performs jump search on a sorted singly linked list of integers, using the square root of the list size as the jump step. Returns a pointer to the node containing the value if found, or NULL if not found or if the list is NULL.

Linear Search in a Skip List

File: 106-linear_skip.c

Description: Implement a C function that performs linear search on a sorted skip list of integers. Returns a pointer to the node containing the value if found, or NULL if not found or if the list is NULL.

Big O #6

File: 107-O

Description: Text file documenting the average time complexity of jump search in a singly linked list of size n, using step = sqrt(n).

Big O #7

File: 108-O

Description: Text file documenting the average time complexity of jump search in a sorted skip list of size n, using step = sqrt(n).

These descriptions maintain the essence of the original tasks while rephrasing them for clarity.
